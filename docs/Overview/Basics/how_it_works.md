# How Notus Works?

:::

Notus is a blockchain infrastructure that enables decentralized applications (dAPPs) to run distributed and managed by the community as a decentralized database. The decentralized database; It is a censorship-proof decentralized data collection that is brought together to keep, run and distribute different information, data and transaction save to other nodes.

Notus Network; It is created with the common use and sharing of processor, memory and storage areas of all nodes connected to the network and distributed to the entire platform. Developers can develop, distribute and run decentralized applications (Defi, NFT, Token, etc.) with tokens and smart contracts that enable them to use the platform.

Since Notus Network is a decentralized organization, all decisions taken are taken by the community, unlike centralized platforms. Decisions and details about the community and management are included in the network after each block created by the validators (NoVa) in the network is approved by the other validators.

Read the whitepaper to learn more about the cryptography, algorithm, and blockchain structure used in the Notus Network design.

## Notus Token

Notus Token is Notus Network's native asset that enables decentralized applications to interact with each other and perform transactions.

Notus Token Usage Status

路 Use for payment to the system to process transactions and store data. <br>
路 Become part of the network by staking a certain amount of Notus Tokens and earn block rewards by running a validator (NoVa) node. <br>
路 Participate in Governance processes and contribute to the development and growth of the network by staking Notus Token. <br>
路 Get Notus token grant by developing decentralized applications (dAPPs) on the network. <br>
