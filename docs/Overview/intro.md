## Introduction

Notus Network is a decentralized blockchain platform that offers a different perspective on scaling and applicability issues. It allows transactions to be completed quickly by distributing payment transactions, new generation Web3 solutions and transaction load within the network within a consensus.

## Key Features

### Scalability

One of the biggest problems of today's platforms is that the bottleneck created by transaction density cannot be overcome.

On the basis of this problem;

· Increasing the intensity of the transaction in a certain time period,

· Limitation of transaction pools,

· "Miners / Validators" prefer high transaction fees while responding to these transactions, and users who choose the base price put their transactions in the back row and these transactions are delayed in completing as the amount of transactions increases,

· As a result of the "Miners / Validators" in competition with each other, the completion times of the blocks are prolonged by entering the process of creating similar blocks more than once in the network,

· Limit on the number of transactions that can be added to the block


In order to solve these observed problems, the “transaction pool” is designed in a distributed manner, including all Miners/Validators. Although the master node has a "transaction pool", all transactions can be sent to other nodes.

There is no upper limit for the transaction information to be added to each block. The block creation time is based on a 0.2 second limit. The main purpose of keeping this time low is to take into account the distribution time of the transactions to all nodes.

In order for scalability to be applicable, each “Miner/Validators” works as a large team in a sequence. The golden rule for “Miners / Validators” to work as a team is to operate in a row.

"Miners/Validators" perform all transactions sequentially by being included in the network within a protocol. Other nodes verify transactions and add them to the chain.

### Low Carbon Footprint

Blockchain platforms also have effects on global climate change due to the high amount of energy they consume. Notus Network has designed the nonce calculation process from the ground up to minimize its low carbon footprint. The low level of difficulty in this redesigned structure causes a security vulnerability. However, the security vulnerability has been eliminated with a different method developed for nonce calculation.

### Full Decentralization

The concept of “Full Decentralization” is at the heart of Notus Network's goals. Our main goal is to maintain the entire process from the transfer process to the decision mechanism in a decentralized manner. In this direction, all users included in Notus Network will have the experience of sharing their transactions directly and with the validators they want.

### Simple Use

With the spread of Web3 applications, the use of blockchain networks and smart contracts running on the blockchain continues to increase day by day.
In order to make the process more efficient, Notus Network has integrated common applications such as Token, NFT, etc., created with smart contracts, into the source code with state development. State development enables project developers to minimize vulnerabilities while writing code and easily start the project development process.


### Speed Transactions

Today, Visa claims it can support 1,700 transactions per second and 24,000 TPS, while Mastercard claims it can support 5,000 transactions. Notus Network aims to enable users to perform more transactions quickly and easily in terms of transactions per second.
